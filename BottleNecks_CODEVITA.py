The program must accept the radii of N bottles as the input. Once a bottle is enclosed inside another bottle,
 it ceases to be visible. A bottle X is enclosed inside another bottle Y only if the following conditions are fulfilled.
1) The bottle X itself is not enclosed in another bottle.
2) The bottle Y does not enclose any other bottle.
3) The radius of the bottle X is smaller than bottle Y.
The program must print the minimum number of visible bottles based on the given conditions.

Note: Optimize your logic to avoid Time Limit Exceed error.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= Radius of each bottle <= 10^18

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains an integer representing the minimum number of visible bottles.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
8
2 3 1 1 4 5 5 3

Output:
2

Explanation:
The radii of the given 8 bottles are 2 3 1 1 4 5 5 3.
The 3rd bottle(1) can be kept in the 1st bottle(2). Now there are 7 visible bottles are 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 5, 3.
Similarly, after performing the following operations, the following will be the corresponding visible bottles.
Operation [Visible bottles]
1 -> 3 [2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 3]
2 -> 3 [3, 4, 5, 5, 3]
3 -> 4 [4, 5, 5, 3]
4 -> 5 [5, 5, 3]
3 -> 5 [5, 5]
Finally, there are 2 bottles that are visible. Hence the output is 2.
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
1 -> 3 -> 5

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
11
1 1 5 5 6 7 8 2 3 4 5

Output:
3

Explanation:
There are 3 bottles that are visible. The one possible way is given below.
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8
1 -> 5
5
